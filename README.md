# GenAdapt --- Genetic-programming-based self-Adaptation approach for resolving congestion in IoT networks
GenAdapt is a novel self-adaptation approach that resolves congestion in IoT systems which uses software-defined network architecture. GenAdapt is based on genetic programming. Using the status of network as input, GenAdapt searches for a formula which resolves congestion with the smallest cost and delay. Once the formula is found, the topology of network is updated by changing the weights of links and flows are rerouted.
